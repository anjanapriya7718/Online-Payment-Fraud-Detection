Online Payments Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning 

---> With the rapid growth of digital transactions, online payment fraud has become a major financial threat. Fraudulent activities can lead to significant monetary losses and security risks. This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning model to automatically detect fraudulent transactions and improve payment security systems.

---> The main aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify online transactions as Fraudulent or Legitimate using machine learning algorithms.

---> The output of this app is to detect whether the transaction made was Legitimate or Fraud based on the previous transactions made.

---> The ML models that are used in this project are Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost Classifier.

---> The Technologies used in developing Frontend part of the project are HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), Flask (Template Rendering).

---> The Technologies used in developing Backend part of the Project are Python, Flask (Web Framework), Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library), Joblib, NumPy.
